# Background
GitHub (github.com) is an online platform that provides hosting for software development and version control.  Version control allows  researchers and coders to work collaboratively and simultaneously when writing and revising code, promoting transparency and providing a forum for discourse and collaboration.  The Quantitative Conservation Laboratory at Boise State University revises, stores, and disseminates code via this platform, and it is imperative that researchers affiliated with this lab become familiar and proficient with the methodology used to work in GitHub.  This tutorial covers basic methods  to conduct fundamental tasks in GitHub.  For more information on the full utility of using this platform, please see other resources such as those available at https://guides.github.com/

# Objectives
The following tutorial is presented as an introduction to using GitHub in combination with RStudio.  It describes the basic protocols used to set up a GitHub account, create an online repository, connect an R project, push and pull information between R and GitHub, and manage and organize online repositories.  

# Outline

1. Set up a GitHub account 

2. Create an online repository to store code and data

3. Construct an example R Project linked to the GitHub repository

4. Transfer information between platforms

# Install "Git" on your computer
If you are working on a Mac, your computer likely already has the Git program installed in the Path "/usr/local/git" or "/usr/bin/git".  However, Windows-based systems do not come with Git.  To install Git follow the instructions for your operating system provided at the URL: 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
For Windows users, open the downloaded install file and accept all of the default options.  **Keep track of the Path where git.exe will be installed.  For most Windows users, this will be "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe".**

# Set up a GitHub account
Prior to working through this tutorial, you'll need to sign up for a GitHub account.

1. Navigate to GitHub's webpage (https://github.com/)  

2. Click the green "Sign up for GitHub" button 

3. Create a professional Username, password, and connect your BSU email with the account

4. Verify your account and click the blue "Create Account" button

# Create a GitHub repository
Repositories are a core foundation of GitHub's infrastructure.  They serve as online directories that contain information that can be shared between researchers affiliated with a project.  All lab members will maintain their own private repositories to store functioning code.   As you write code on your local computer, it is imperative that you frequently save ("commit" and "push") the code to your online repository.  **Do not store code on GitHub that is broken or not functioning as intended.**  Saving working code in the online repository provides an invaluable safety net if your code gets broken on your local computer.  If this happens, you can simply reload the previous version stored on GitHub.  In this tutorial, you will be introduced to these concepts and components through the creation of a simple repository and transfer of information between this repository and an example R Project.  

First, navigate to your GitHub's homepage and create an online repository following these steps:

1. Click the green "Create repository" button on the left of the screen if this is your first time creating a repository.  If you already have access to other repositories, the green button will be labeled "New" instead.

\newline

2. In the next window, provide preliminary information for the repository. 
  - Name the repository "GitHub_Tutorial_Repository"
  - Provide a brief description of the repository
  - Set the repository to "Private"
  - Click the box "Add a README file"
  - Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the screen 

![](Screenshots/Final/Repository_Info.png){width=400px}
\newline

*A new repository has now been created.  Researchers with permission can now access the components of the repository.  For this example, "README.md" contains the the description of the repository you wrote when creating the repository.*  

3. Click the green dropdown menu "Code" and press the clipboard icon to copy the repository's URL (hereafter, "Repository_URL")

![](Screenshots/Final/Repository_URL.png){width=450px}

*This is the unique URL associated with the repository.  You will use this URL to connect your subsequent R Project to this online repository.*

# Connect GitHub to RStudio and link repository with R Project
This section focuses on the basic methods used to connect online repositories with R Projects.  The following steps describe how to make a new project and connect it with the online repository you just created.

1. Create a new R Project 
  - Open RStudio
  - Click the "File" tab at the top left of the screen
  - Select "New Project" from the dropdown menu
  - Click "New Directory"
  - Click "New Project"
  - Name the project "GitHub_Tutorial"
  - Click the "Browse" button and select the appropriate PATH where the project will be located 
  - Check the "Create a git repository" box
  - Click "Create Project"

![](Screenshots/Final/RProject_1.png){width=450px}

*Your new project's directory will be a folder located in the PATH you designated.  Currently, this directory only contains a .Rproj file.*

2. Set up version control with Git 
  - Click on the "Tools" tab at the top of screen
  - Select "Global Options" from the dropdown menu
  - Select the "Git/SVN" tab at the left side of the window and click the "Enable version control for RStudio projects" box if it is not already checked.  *You may need to provide the Path to the "Git executable".  If this is the case, click the "Browse" button and navigate to the Path where git.exe is located on your computer.*
 - Click the "Apply" button (follow the prompt to restart the R session)
 
3. Link GitHub with the R Project
  - Click on the "Tools" tab at the top of screen
  - Select "Project Options" from the dropdown menu
  - Select the "Git/SVN" tab at the left side of the window and click "Git" from the "Version control system:" dropdown menu if it is not already selected
  - Click apply/OK at the bottom of the window (follow the prompts to restart the R session)
  
4. Link the repository's URL with the R Project
  - Click on the "Tools" tab at the top of screen
  - Select "Shell"
    - This will open a separate shell terminal window
  - Type the following code in the shell terminal window and press enter:

    git remote add origin Repository_URL 

*For this example, "Repository_URL" is the unique URL associated with the online repository you copied earlier.  You can paste this in the shell terminal window.  "origin" now represents the online repository.*

5. Pull the information stored in the online repository to sync the two platforms
  - Type the following code in the shell terminal window and press enter:
  
    git pull origin main

![](Screenshots/Final/RProject_2.png){width=450px}

*This step "pulls" the contents located in the "main" branch of your online repository and places the information in your project's directory.  Note how the R Project's directory now contains the "README.md" file originally located in the online repository.*   
  
# Working in RStudio
Now that the R Project and online repository are linked, changes to the R Project can be "pushed" back to the online repository.  For this tutorial, you will process a very basic example data set, write several lines of code in an R script, "commit" these changes, and "push" the "commit" to the online repository.  The experimental data you will use is a comma-separated values file named "CountMatrix.csv".

![](Screenshots/Final/CountMatrix_1.png){width=400px}

*These data represent counts of different animal species (Columns) at cameras located at 4 different geographic sites (Rows).  Each cell "value" represents the number of each species counted at each site.*

1. Add the experimental data to the R project
  - Right-click in the R Project directory and create a new folder named "Data" 
  - Click and drag the experimental data .csv file into the "Data" folder

![](Screenshots/Final/RProject_3.png){width=450px}

*The project's directory now contains the subdirectory "Data" which contains the data file "CountMatrix.csv".*

2. Create a new R Script 
  - Click on the green plus symbol in top left of RStudio window
  - Select "R Script" from the dropdown menu
  - Click the floppy disk icon and name the script "GitHub_Code"

![](Screenshots/Final/New_RScript.png){width=150}![](Screenshots/Final/RProject_4.png){width=450px}

*The project's directory now contains the "GitHub_Code.R" script file.*

3. Write the initial code in the R Script.  For this example, the basic code to load two R Packages and import the data set is provided.  Type this code in the "GitHub_Code.R" script file and click the floppy disk icon to save. 
```{r initial_code, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)

# Import data into R 
CountMatrix <- read.csv("Data/CountMatrix.csv")

```

# Initial GitHub commit and push to repository
You have now made several additions to your R Project.  However, these changes have only been made on your local computer.  Remember, the GitHub repository solely contains the "README.md" file at this time.  The following steps describe how to "commit" the changes you have made and "push" them to the online repository.    

1. Navigate to the "Git" tab/pane at the top right of your window
  - Click on the "master" dropdown and select "main"
  - This user interface will be where you perform all subsequent Git-related tasks
  
![](Screenshots/Final/Git_Pane.png){width=400}
\newline
  
2. Check the boxes next to the files you want to transfer to the online repository.  For this example, select the "GitHub_Code.R" and "Data/CountMatrix.csv" files.
  - Boxes will turn green
  - Click the "Commit" button
  - In the new window, add a short, descriptive commit message
  - Click the "Commit" button in the new window when finished
  
![](Screenshots/Final/Git_Commit_2.png){width=400}

*You can make a "commit" at any time, however, only "commit" components that you are confident are correct and fully functional.  These will not be stored in your online repository until you "push" the "commit" (which requires an internet connection).  Always prioritize "committing" changes on your local computer first, especially when collecting data or writing code in the field.*  

3. "Push" the commit to the GitHub repository
  - In the "Git" pane/tab in the top right of the window, click the green "up" arrow
*This will push "Initial commit" to the online repository*

4. Navigate to the online repository to make sure the push was successful
  - You may need to refresh web page
   
![](Screenshots/Final/Master_5.png){width=400px}

*"GitHub_Code.R" and the "Data" directory containing "CountMatrix.csv" should now be located in "main" along with the original "README.md" file.*
