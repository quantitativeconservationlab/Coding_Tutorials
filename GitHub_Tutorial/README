This respository is meant to be an introduction to getting set up with GitHub.

There is a tutorial put together by Boise State students Jessica Taylor and Nora Honkomp https://github.com/JessicaTaylor55/Git_Tutorial
And a second tutorial that further expands on the one above https://isdrfall23.classes.spaseslab.com/lesson/getting-setup.html
There is a pdf version of the tutorial linked in this repository (Chapter_12.html)

Lots of information can also be found at this site https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git.
