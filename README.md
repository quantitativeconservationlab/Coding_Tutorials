# Coding_Tutorials
This repository contains basic tutorials covering concepts related to using GitHub, creating an R project, and coding in R Studio.  

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the GitHub platform by working through the "GitHub_Tutorial" first, followed by the "Basic_R_Tutorial" and the "Spatial_Tutorial". Some have struggled with the Github tutorial. If you are new to Github, it may help to start here:

To complete tutorials in this repository, you will need to download the "CountMatrix.csv" file located in the "Data" folder in the "Basic_R_Tutorial" directory.  To download this file: 

1) Click on "CountMatrix.csv"
2) Right-click on the "Raw" button
3) Click "Save link as..." from the dropdown menu and select where you would like to save the file
4) The file will be downloaded as a ".txt" file, you can convert this back to a ".csv" file by changing the extension from .txt to .csv

We also recommend that you download Google Chrome and set it as your default web browser to use when accessing the GitHub materials.

We thank the NSF Track 2 EPSCoR Program award number OIA-1826801 and the NSF Idaho EPSCoR Program award number OIA-1757324 for support in developing these tutorials.
